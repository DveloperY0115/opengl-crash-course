## Introduction
A C/C++ project repository using OpenGL which is created on the purpose of preparing for **[CS380: Introduction to Computer Graphics]** course held at KAIST in spring 2021. The sources are built on C++17 and can be compiled using g++, clang++, and MSVC. Currently this project supports Windows and macOS only (I haven't tested the codes on Linux and other UNIX-family systems yet).
